In week two, I learnt how to clean data starting from removing the current formating on the data. I was able to apply different text functions such as the PROPER, UPPER and LOWER function. I used different editing tools and I was able to use the TRIM function to remove spaces inbetween text. I also used the find and replace function as well as removing duplicate from the Data toolbar. I also converted my cleaned data to a tabular form to make it ready and easy for analysis. i also used other functions such as concatenate on sheet 3 to merge text on different cells together.
